Recreated Promotional email for Shopify using MJML framework to speed up process, have the code rendered from MJML language to HTML5 and make edits to any underlying issues or ability to make small changes when necessary. MJML is a framework I have used in the past to make fast mockup-templates without having to completely start from scratch as you would in HTML without a boilerplate. After switching from MJML language to HTML, I make sure everything in media queries, css and inline styles are in working condition or make changes especially for outlook email client.
